# Day03
On the third day, we learned about R. A great tool, which i will find useful to keep track of food supplies and medicine. But the food is getting low and my vision is getting blurry, i must hold on. There are two days left, my mind is telling me yes, but my body, my body... 
I don't know if i'll be able to hold on... (smh)
